--------------> SDLC 

SDLC --> is a process used by the software industry to design,
develop high quality software.
The SDLC aims to produce a high quality software that meets
or exceeds customer expections, reaches completion within
times and cost estimates.

SDLC - Models 
1. Waterfall model
WaterFall ----> upward to downward --> up to down -- top to bottom

Waterfall model was first SDLC model to be used widely in 
Sotware Engineering to ensure success of the project.

in "The waterfall " approach the whole process of software 
development is divided into separate phrases. 

1) Requirement Gathering and Analysis
--------> Documented 
2) System Design
--------->  gathering hardware and software info
3) Implementatiion
--------> Gathered info should be put into the code
Note: The code should be standard one.
4) Testing
--------> soiftware designed and developed needs to tested
5) Deployement 
------> With the quality of software we could deploy it
6) Maintaince
----------------------
-----> Maintain the software for its working !!!!!!

2) Waterwall model - Application
---------------------------------------------------------
-- Requirement are very well documented, clear and fixed 
-- Product Defination Stable
-- Technology is understood is not dynamic
-- There are no ambigious requirements
-- Ample resources with required expertise are available
   to support the product
-- The project is short.
3) Advantages
-------------------------
-- Simple and easy to understand and usage
-- Easy to manage to the rigidity of the model.
-- Phrases are processed and completed at once.
-- Works well for smaller projects
-- Clearly desined stages
-- well understood milestones
-- easy to arrange the task

4) Dis-advantages
------------------------------
-- No working softwate is produced until late during the 
life cycle
-- High amount of risk and uncertainty
-- Not a good model for complex and objected projects
-- Poor model for long and ongoing Project
-- It is difficult to measire progess within stages
-- Can not accomodate changing requirements.


2) Agile-Scrum Model
------------------------------------
Agile Model 
-------------------
Agile SDLC 
------------> is module of combination of iterative and 
incremental process, (Counting --- Increasing) --> loops
which focus on process adaptability and customer satisfaction.

-- This is responsible for Rapid delivery of working software.

-- Areas of Agile
1) Planning
2) Requirement Ananlysis
3) Desining
4) Coding
5) Unit Testing 
6) Acceptance Testing

--> Agile model is describes that every project to be handled
differently an the existing methods needs to toilered to the best
requirements.

-- Architecture of the Agile Method
---------------------------------------------------------
 
Agile Methodologies/prncliple
--------------------------------------------------
1) Individuals and Interactions: In agile development, 
self orgnisation and motivation are important, as are 
interactions like co-location and pair programming.

2) Working Sofware: Demo working software is considered 
the means of communication with the customers to understand
their requirements, instead of just depending on documentation.

3) Customer Collaboration: As the requirements cannot be 
gathered completely in the beginning of the project, due to various
factors, we continue communicating the customer in seeking
proper product requirements.

4) Responding to the change: Agile development is focused on 
quck responses to change and continuous development.

Advantages of Agile module:
---------------------- 
1) Is a veru realistic approach to doftware evelopement
2) Promotes the team work and cross traning
3) Functionality can be developed rapidly and demostrated
4) Resource requirement are minimum
5) Delivers early partial working solutions
6) Easy to manage
7) Gives the flexibility to developers

Disadvantages:
-------------------------
---- Not suitable for handling complex dependencies
---- More risk of sustainability, maintainability and extensibility.
----An overall plan, an agile leader and agile PM pratice is a must  without
which it will not work 
--- Highly depended on individual work.

Basic Structure of Unix 
---------------------------------
Unix : The Unix Operating system (OS) 
consists of a Kernal Layer, a shell layer, and a untilities and application layers.

These are used for 
1) Portable, Multiuser, Multitasking Operating Systems.


Linux  					Unix
The Source code of linux us freely                  The Source code of unix is not really
avaiable to its user                                          freely available general public

It has graphical user user interface                  It has only Command Line Interface
along with CLI (Command Line Interface 

Linux OS is portable, Flexible, and can be          Unix OS is not Portable 
executed in different harddrives

Different versions of Linux OS are Ubuntu,       Different versions of Unix are
Linux Mint, Redhat Enterprise linux, Solaris       IBM AIS, HP-UX, BSD,Irix,macOS, Darwin etc
ets
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic Unix Commands
--------------------------------
We need to launch the terminal (Command Prompt)
RedHat@Desktop> : System Path 
system path> 

Unix  Files Commands
---------------------------------------
1) ls ------> Lists your files of the system
2) ls -l  ------> Lists your files in the long format, Which contains 
                     Exact size of thefile, Who owns the file and who has 
                     right access to look at it., and when it was modified
3) ls -a : Lists all files, including the ones whose filenames begins in .dot (. hidden)
these files will been seen always
4) mv --> (move) --> 
syntax:
mv filename1 filename2 --> Moves a file (i.e gives it a different name)
ex:
mv sachin.txt DBMS 
5) cp (copy) 
syntax
cp filename1 filename2 --> Copies the files
6) rm (remove) 
syntax:
rm filename ----> Removes a file.
7) rm -i ---> remove ---> this will ask for a confirmation that you 
wanted to remove the file.
8) wc (count) ----> Tells you how many lines,words and charecters there are in a file.
9) chmod (permissions) : lets you chage the read, write and execute permissions

2) Unix Directory Commands : folders
-------------------------------------------------------
1) mkdir (make directory) : make a new directory.
2) cd ( change directory -- Name) : Change directory.
3) pwd (present working directory) : Tells you where you current are

3) Finding things
-----------------------------
1) ff - find files, anywhere on the system.
This is extremy usefull, when you have
forgotten the directory that you put a file.

2) ff -p : You don't even need the fullname,
starting letter. this will be usefull for finding
other things on the system.
3) grep string filename(s)
looks for the string in the file. 
-- this can be useful a lot of purposes.

4) About other people
-------------------------------
1) w - tells you who's logged in, What they 
are doing in. 
2) who :- tells you who's logged on, and where
they are coming from.
usefull if you are looking for some one 
who's actually physically in the same system
path. 

3) talk username : lets you have a (typed)
conversation with another user
4)  write username: Lets you exchange 
one-line message with another user

Other Unix Commands
=--------------------------------
1) whoami -- returns you username,
2) passwd --- Lets you change your password 

passwd **************

3) ps -u yourusername :- lets you processess, 
contains lot of information about them. 

ps -u codingmachine : hit enter 

4) kill PID ---
